## MyExpApp = _My Experimental Apps for node.js_

This is my first shot for learning Node.js framework. It's a demostration for testing Node.js, Express, Pug template phaser and some awesome package came from npm and somewhere on internet.

__Compiling Notes__: 

Since this application imported a module [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas). Its library files vary from the different OS system with regards to your development environment. So you might rebuild the node-canvas with **node-pre-gyp** by `npm install canvas --save` on your own OS system firstly. If you cannot compile this package successfully, please check out [compiling section](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas#compiling) on this page.

__Development environment__:

- Platform OS: Ubuntu 18.10 ~ 19.10 / Deepin 15.11 ~ 20

- Coding tool: VS Code

- Experimental Framework: Node.js + Express + Pug + JQuery

- VCS and repo.: Git / Github
