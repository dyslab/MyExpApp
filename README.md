"#MyExpApp" 

This is my first shot for learning Node.js framework. It's a demostration for testing Node.js, Express, Pug template phaser and some awesome package came from npm and somewhere on internet.

Note: Since this application imported a module "node-canvas"(https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas). Its library files might be vary from the different OS system with regards to your development environment. So you might rebuild the node-canvas by "npm install --save node-canvas" on your own OS system firstly if you cannot build this package suceessfully when you want to have a test.

My development environment:

Platform OS: Ubuntu 18.10
Coding tool: VS Code
VCS and repo. tools: Git / npm
